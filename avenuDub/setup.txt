In order to be able to call the api endpoints when running the app using Expo Go,
you have to use your computer's IP address instead of localhost.
Make a copy of the file example-config.js and rename it `config.js`. It must have the
exact same filename, otherwise you'll get a bunch of import errors
To get your computer's IP address, open a terminal and run `ifconfig | grep inet` on Mac, or
`ipconfig` on Windows

For MacOS/Linux:
Your IP address will be on the line under the line that has `en0` in it. It should be in
the format XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX if using IPv4 or in XXXX:XXXX:XXXX:XXXX if using IPv6
If the line has multiple IP addresses, use the first one.

Set the BASE_URL variable to your computer's IP address, run the backend in a separate terminal,
and then the frontend should be able to hit the API endpoints.

IMPORTANT: .gitignore should not be able to add config.js to a commit, but make sure it isn't added
when you're doing a commit so your IP address isn't publicly available.

If you're running the frontend under a different wifi network than the last time you ran it, you'll
most likely have to change the IP address in config.js

You may also have to change the port number depending on how the backend is ran
